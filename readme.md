# Growth Spark Starter Theme v1.1 - Release Notes

## Auto-Loading for Includes

Updated core.php file will automatically load PHP files placed in the /includes/ folder or in the root of any direct sub-directories (ie /includes/folder-name).

This helps reduce clutter in the functions.php and eliminates the need to manually include each new file in functions.php.

Files whose names are appended with -sample are not included (ie widget-sample.php).

## Custom Admin Features

New sub-folder of /includes/ called "admin" houses various modules which customize the WordPress admin interface:

### Theme Styles applied to TinyMCE Editor

Visual styling of content in the TinyMCE Editor will reflect theme styles set in style.css, offering users a more realistic preview of what the live page will look like.

### Simplified TinyMCE Toolbar

Allows customization of the TinyMCE toolbar.  Can be tweaked on a per-theme basis to suit clients' needs.

Defaults:
* "Heading 1" removed from the formats menu (each page should only have one h1 tag, typically reserved for the page title)
* Justify, strikethrough, and spell-checker buttons disabled
* Menu condensed to one row instead of two

### Customized Admin Menu Ordering

Defaults:
* "Pages" tab is pushed to the top of the menu, just below "Dashboard".  Pages are usually the most used feature, plus it's important to have it next to Posts & other CPTs. 

### Custom User Capabilities

Defaults:
* Users with the "Editor" role now have the ability to manage Widgets, Menus, & Theme Options
* The "Tools" menu is hidden for all users below Admin

## Custom Post Type Boilerplate 

Updated cpt-sample.php: Improved code organization and added variables to reduce the amount of customization needed to create a new CPT.

## Custom Theme Widgets

Now included with the theme are 2 custom widgets:

### Feature Box

Simple text widget with added option for a "Read More" link / button.  Seems to be a feature that I need to implement a lot, and should help save development time.  Also eliminates need for hard-coding URLs.

### Recent Posts ++

Enhanced Recent Posts widget which supports:

- Custom Post Types
- Date formatting
- Excerpts
- Thumbnails

## Default Templates

I've added 2 default templates back in for index.php & front-page.php.  If these are useful for you we can leave them in, otherwise we can just strip them out and I'll work on an alternate version that has more extensive starting templates.


## Comments Template

Added an updated comments.php which features a clean, compact layout and provided starting styles in style.css.

## JavaScript


### jQuery Cycle
Minified version of jQuery Cycle now included by default in /js/.  Starting settings are in functions.php, with the expectation that they'll be modified or removed.

## CSS

Added base.css (normalization) and grid.css (12-column grid system) to the /css/ folder.  These are to serve as examples, but with the expectation that they can be removed/altered/etc. 

Enqueue-ing of theme stylesheets has been moved to functions.php, with the expectation that stylesheets will be customized on a per-theme basis.   

Developers should configure their stylesheets in functions.php using wp_register_style and should NOT hard-code them as <link > elements in header.php.  This allows us to control the order in which theme stylesheets load in relation to other stylesheets generated by plugins & the WP Core.
